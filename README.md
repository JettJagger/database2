# database2

I created this backend database as part of CodeNation's Software development bootcamp. 

# Criteria 

1. Create a full REST API with a DB layer, token auth and password hashing.
2. At least a user model with relevant routes and controllers to cover CRUD.
3. All routes must be tested in Thunder Client/Insomnia/Postman.

Great work Jett! I really like that you have documented all your code. This really helps cement your understanding and will help you retain your learning. In addition, it will really help when you come to revisit the code in future. Your routes are all excellent with the optimal use of TokenCheck and PasswordCheck. You have also included the stretch objective of email validation in the database.  Well done!
EBI:
You forgot to populate the .gitignore file so your password for your Clever Cloud database will be on GitHub for the world to see. You have probably already received a few emails from Git Guardian to tell you about this. The only way to get rid of this is to completely delete the repository and re-upload everything. It is painful lesson to learn but everybody makes this mistake at some point during your career and it is good to learn it early. 
Overall fabulous work Jett! Well done!
